   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sjbentley/llm_chatbot.git

    Navigate to the Project Directory:

cd llm_chatbot

Place Your API Key:

The API key and URL are defined in script.js. You can update these values:

// In script.js
const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
const API_URL = `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key=${API_KEY}`;

Open the Application:

Simply open index.html in your web browser. Alternatively, you can serve the files using a simple HTTP server:

    npx http-server .

    Then navigate to http://localhost:8080 (or whichever port is shown).

## Usage

    Chat Interaction: Type your query into the prompt input and press Enter or click the send button. For example, try asking for a Python script to retrieve ticker prices.

    File Upload: Click the attach file button to upload a file. Uploaded files will be shown as a preview or as a file icon with the file name.

    Theme Toggle: Click the theme toggle button to switch between light and dark modes.

## Project Structure

/frontend
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html         # Main HTML file
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css          # Stylesheet for the application
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js          # JavaScript code for the chatbot functionality
